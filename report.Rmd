```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

# Load the datasets

Train
```{r}
training = read.csv(file = "pml-training.csv")
```

Test
```{r}
testing = read.csv(file = "pml-testing.csv")
```

# Exploratory analysis

Print variables
```{r}
names(training)
```




Near zero variance variables:
```{r}
library(caret)
nzvVariables = nearZeroVar(training)
```

Number of variables before vs after
```{r}
length(names(training))
length(names(training)) - length(nzvVariables)
names(training)[nzvVariables]
```


Define new training set (with only non near zero variance variables)

```{r}
#training = training[, -nzvVariables]
```

# Predictive modeling

<!-- Imputing missing values: -->
<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- library(mice) -->
<!-- tmpData = mice(data = training, method = "pmm") -->
<!-- training = complete(tmpData) -->
<!-- ``` -->


```{r}
cc = complete.cases(training)
table(cc)
training = training[cc,]
```


```{r}
training_x = subset(training, select = -classe)
training_y = training[,"classe"]
modelFit = train(x = training_x, y = training_y, preProcess = c("center", "scale", "nzv"), method = "gbm", trControl = trainControl(method = "cv", number = 5))
```

Test:
```{r}
result = predict(modelFit, newdata = training)
confusionMatrix(result, training_y)
testResult = predict(modelFit, newdata = testing)
```
